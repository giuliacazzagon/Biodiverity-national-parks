# Biodiverity-national-parks
 
### Project goals

The goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations.

This project will try to answer the following questions:

+ What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
+ Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
+ Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?

**Data sources:**

Both `Observations.csv` and `Species_info.csv` was provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com).

Note: The data for this project is *inspired* by real data, but is mostly fictional.

### Project structure

The project is divided in the following sections:
- **Import Python modules**: import modules that will be necessary for the project
- **Loading the Data**: load data into dataframes and have a glance at the data
- **Cleaning the Data**: check for null values, duplicates, data types and change specific names if necessary
- **Analysis**: explore data, make data visualization and answer questions of project goals 
- **Conclusions**: summarize findings and suggest future directions
